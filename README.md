Solutions to Advent of Code 2015 in Rust. 

In trying to learn Rust I decided to do all of the 2015 Advent of Code assignments in Rust. Since this is / was some of the first code I ever wrote in Rust, there are several things I've learned along the way and the code is (I hope) evolving over time, I have decided to leave the first solutions as they were written to be able to look back on it after I gain more experience and see what confused be at the time.
